Search Algorithms:

1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search (for sorted arrays)
3. Jump Search
4. Interpolation Search
5. Exponential Search

Array Operations:

1. Insertion at a specific position
2. Deletion from a specific position
3. Update/Replace element at a given index
4. Traverse and Display

Linked List Operations:

1. Singly Linked List:

-> Insertion at the beginning, end, and a specific position
-> Deletion from the beginning, end, and a specific position
-> Traversal and Search

2. Doubly Linked List:

-> Same operations as above, but with bidirectional traversal

3. Circular Linked List:

-> Insertion and deletion in a circular structure

Stack Operations:

1. Push (add an element)
2. Pop (remove an element)
3. Peek (view the top element)
4. Traversal (display the entire stack)
5. Applications like balancing parentheses, postfix evaluation, etc.

Queue Operations:

1. Enqueue (add element)
2. Dequeue (remove element)
3. Front and Rear (view the elements at the front and rear)
4. Traversal
5. Circular Queue
6. Priority Queue (optional if you want to explore this advanced concept)

Tree Operations (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees):

1. Insertion (add node)
2. Deletion (remove node)
3. Search (find node)
4. Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
5. Balancing Algorithms like AVL Trees or Red-Black Trees (for an advanced challenge)
6. Heap Operations (Min-Heap, Max-Heap insertions, and deletions)

Graph Algorithms (Using Adjacency List or Matrix):

1. Graph Representation (adjacency list or matrix)
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3. Depth-First Search (DFS)
4. Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)
5. Kruskal’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)

5. Array Display Area: A canvas or area to display the array visually. Each element could be represented as a bar of varying height/length based on its value.

6. Start/Play Button: A button to start or play the visualization of the selected algorithm.

7. Pause/Resume Button: A button to pause or resume the ongoing visualization.

8. Reset Button: A button to reset the array and visualization to the initial state.

9. Step-By-Step Mode: A button or checkbox to allow users to view the algorithm step-by-step, with forward/backward buttons to move through the process.

10. Status/Info Display: A small area to display information like the current step, comparisons, or swaps made during the algorithm execution.

11. Code Display Area: A separate section or panel to display the pseudo-code or actual code of the selected algorithm being visualized.

12. Progress Bar: A progress bar to show the percentage of the algorithm that has been executed.

13. Sound Toggle: Option to enable or disable sound effects for various actions (optional).

16. Documentation Section: This will display theoretical information about the selected algorithm, and include links to external resources like GeeksforGeeks and youtube videos for further reading.

17. AI Chatbot: Embedded chatbot for suggesting algorithms, answering questions, and providing insights during the visualization process.

18. Performance Metrics: Display time and space complexity for each operation.
